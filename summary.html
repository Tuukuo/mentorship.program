            Trevor Noah the author of Born a Crime talks about his childhood during apartheid. Trevor
             says that in South Africa Sexual relationships between races were against the law, <br>but
              his mother became friends with a Swiss man who had an apartment in the city and they got 
              a mixed child named Trevor. This relates <br>to Kajiado where intermarriages between 
              communities are not allowed but people still break this law and have children outside 
              their communities. Another theme displayed in these two <br>chapters is family dynamics 
              which is displayed through Trevor’s relationship with his mother.
            In my county, this theme is also displayed where children receive unconditional love and <br>
            protection from their mothers. These two chapters also talk about how people in Patricia’s
             community do not expect women to pursue some courses. This also happens in <br>Kajiado 
             County where people think women can’t handle intense courses. People in Kajiado like Noah
              and his mother  use humor to cope with life challenges. Kajiado county's <br>diverse 
              population's  challenges  and poverty can resonate with Noah's experience under apartheid. 
              Another theme displayed by Trevor in this  book is racism in SouthAfrica which also 
              relates <br>to my County where people are ranked according to their race. The whites are 
              thought to be of higher rank and  black people are thought to be <br>of low rank. Trevor 
              displays courage and perseverance through Patricia, his mother. In Kajiado, women face a 
              lot of challenges when raising their children but they persevere
            and show support to their kids.
