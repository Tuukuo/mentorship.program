            Trevor Noah the author of Born a Crime talks about his childhood during apartheid. Trevor
             says that in South Africa Sexual relationships<br> between races were against the law, but
              his mother became friends with a Swiss man who had an apartment in the city and they got 
              a mixed <br>child named Trevor. This relates to Kajiado where intermarriages between 
              communities are not allowed but people still break this law and have<br> children outside 
              their communities. Another theme displayed in these two chapters is family dynamics 
              which is displayed through Trevor’s <br>relationship with his mother.
            In my county, this theme is also displayed where children receive unconditional love and <br>
            protection from their mothers. These two chapters also talk about how people in Patricia’s
             community do not expect women to pursue some courses.<br> This also happens in Kajiado 
             County where people think women can’t handle intense courses. People in Kajiado like Noah
              and his mother  use humor to <br>cope with life challenges. Kajiado county's diverse 
              population's  challenges  and poverty can resonate with Noah's experience under apartheid. 
              Another<br> theme displayed by Trevor in this  book is racism in SouthAfrica which also 
              relates to my County where people are ranked according to their race. The<br> whites are 
              thought to be of higher rank and  black people are thought to be of low rank. Trevor 
              displays courage and perseverance through Patricia, his <br>mother. In Kajiado, women face a 
              lot of challenges when raising their children but they persevere
            and show support to their kids.
