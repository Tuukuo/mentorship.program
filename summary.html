        <p class="summary_paragraph2">Trevor Noah the author of Born a Crime tells stories of his childhood during apartheid.<br>
            His mother was a devoted christian who took them to three churches every sunday.<br>
             Trevor enjoyed attending church. One sunday his mother threw him out of a car. <br>
             Trevor asked his mother if God would be meeting them at home instead of them going to church.<br> 
             Sexual relationships between races were against the law . It was illegal for black people to live<br>
              within the city but Trevor's mother ran away from home to live and work in Johannesburg.<br>
               She became friends with a Swiss man who had an apartment in the city.His mother got a child<br> 
               with the swiss man, and this was Trevor who is of mixed race.Trevor’s existence indicated <br>
               criminal behaviors. His mother’s rebellious approach to life is evident in her decision to have<br> 
                a child of mixed race.
               <br>
           One of the themes displayed by Trevor in this book is racism in SouthAfrica which also exists <br>
           in Kajiado County where social status influences job opportunities and treatment within the society.<br>
            Family dynamics and cultural heritage explored in these chapters reflect the importance of <br>
            community and tradition in Kajiado county, where cultural values and ancestral customs play <br>
            a significant role in people’s lives.
            People in Kajiado like Noah and his mother use humor to cope with life challanges.<br>Kjiado is composed of
            ethnic groups and this relates to Noah's struggle with identity and belonging in a racial society.<br>
            Kajiado county's diverse population and the challanges poverty can resonate with Noah's experienceunder apartheid.</optgroup>
