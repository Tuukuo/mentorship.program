        <p class="summary_paragraph2">Trevor Noah the author of Born a Crime tells stories of his childhood during apartheid.
            His mother was a devoted christian who took them to three churches every<br> sunday.
             Trevor enjoyed attending church. One Sunday his mother threw him out of a car. 
             Trevor asked his mother if God would be meeting them at home instead of <br> them  going to church.
             Sexual relationships between races were against the law . It was illegal for black people to live
              within the city but Trevor's mother ran away from<br>  home to live and work in Johannesburg.
               She became friends with a Swiss man who had an apartment in the city.His mother got a child
               with the swiss man, and this was <br> Trevor who is a mixed race child. Trevor’s  existence indicated 
               criminal behaviors. His mother’s rebellious approach to life is evident in her decision to have
                a child of mixed <br> race.
           One of the themes displayed by Trevor in this  book is racism in SouthAfrica which also exists 
           in Kajiado County  <br> treatment within the society is based on peoples races.
            Family dynamics and cultural heritage explored in  these chapters reflect the importance of 
            community and tradition in Kajiado county ,<br>  where cultural values and ancestral customs play 
            a significant role in people’s lives.
            People in Kajiado like Noah and his mother  use humor to cope with life challanges.<br> Kajiado is composed of
            ethnic groups and this relates to Noah's struggle with identity and belonging in a racial society.
            Kajiado county's diverse population's  challanges <br> and poverty can resonate with Noah's experience under apartheid.
